        "description": "Built a real-time chat application using JavaFX for the front-end and Java for the back-end. The app supports multiple users, sending text messages, and even sharing images! Key features include real-time messaging, user authentication, image sharing, and a dynamic UI. Tech stack includes JavaFX for the front-end and Java with Socket Programming for real-time communication. Methods used include Socket Programming, Java Object Serialization, Multithreading, JavaFX Controls, and Base64 Encoding. A hands-on project exploring JavaFX, Socket Programming, and UI design. Exciting to implement features like image sharing and real-time messaging!",
